               <p class="funParagraph">As a young girl, I read books, watched documentaries, and watched TV shows about the weather. I grew up in central Texas, where I often saw severe weather. More specifically, I was interested in tornadoes. I love how cool they looked. I also thought it was cool that some people would chase them. Now, that is too scary for me. </p>
               <p>As I got older, I realized that tornadoes were not only cool but also dangerous and caused a lot of destruction. So, I decided to improve the prediction of tornadoes. I want to create a device using AI to predict tornadoes hours or days before they happen. </p>
               <p>I also dream of the day when I can work as a meteorologist in the National Weather Service. I plan to use my degree and knowledge in computer science to help me get into the door, and I plan to get a master's in meteorology.</p>
